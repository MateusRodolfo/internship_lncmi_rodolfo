Codes developed during Rodolfo's internship at LNCMI

Made by [Mateus Rodolfo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusgrodolfo/) during an internship at LNCMI (CNRS) supervised by Eric Beaugnon.

Uses the [magpylib](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711020300170) python library. Thanks [Mr Ortner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ortner-b6b724143/) for all  the help provided.

Contains examples files using the source code (no imports), using the library as an import as well as magpylib examples for magnet setup.
