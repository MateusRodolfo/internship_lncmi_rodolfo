# internship_lncmi_rodolfo
GitHub repository for sharing codes developed during Rodolfo's internship at LNCMI

Functional version of the code. v0.1-alpha.

Made by [Mateus Rodolfo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusgrodolfo/) during an internship at LNCMI (CNRS) supervised by Eric Beaugnon.

Uses the [magpylib](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711020300170) python library. Thanks [Mr Ortner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ortner-b6b724143/) for all  the help provided.

Still needs descriptions and examples.
